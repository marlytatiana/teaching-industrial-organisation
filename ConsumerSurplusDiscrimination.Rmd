## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r consumer surplus, echo=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
qMarket1 <- seq(0, 2, by = 0.5)
aMarket1 <- 2
bMarket1 <- 1
idemandMarket1 <- aMarket1 - bMarket1* qMarket1  # Linear inverse demand equation: P = 2-x
priceMarket1 <-1.5

# Create a data frame
market1 <- data.frame(qMarket1, idemandMarket1)


# Plot the linear inverse demand curve
demandmarket1 <- ggplot(market1, aes(x = qMarket1, y = idemandMarket1)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1, linetype = "solid") +
  # Add labels
  labs(title = "Linear Inverse Demand Curve",
       x = "Quantity",
       y = "Price") +
  # Customize the theme
  theme_minimal()
# Print the plot
print(demandmarket1)
```
